<h2 id="exchange">Exchange</h2>

<p>Exchange GUI is in progress.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/6H4x6eQ.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
<li>The exchange client is a very light weight terminal application.</li>
<li>When exchange app starts, you put in your pass phrase for deterministic wallet generation</li>
<li>It communicates with exchange over encrypted channel.</li>

<li><p>You can transfer between local wallet and the exchange very easily</p></li>

<li><p>As long as you remember you wallet password (the phrase that generates the wallet), then you can access the coins from anywhere.</p></li>

<li><p>There is no physical wallet, on disc that can be confiscated or even proven to exist</p></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="example-1">Example 1:</h5>

<ul>
<li>start exchange</li>
<li>put in key for deterministic wallet generation</li>
<li>send Skycoin to exchange from local wallet</li>
<li>sell Skycoin for Bitcoin</li>
<li>Send Exchange Bitcoin to remote address</li>
<li>Pull remaining skycoin back to local wallet</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="example-2">Example 2:</h5>

<ul>
<li>start exchange client</li>
<li>put in wallet generation pass phrase</li>
<li>check bitcoin balance for local wallet</li>
<li>send bitcoin from local wallet to an address (sign transaction, inject transaction)</li>
<li>close exchange client</li>
</ul>

<p>This is not really an &ldquo;exchange&rdquo; or a client. It is more like a bloomberg terminal for Bitcoin/Skycoin.</p>

<p>You do not need to &ldquo;login&rdquo; to the exchange with a user name or password
- your public key authenticates your identity</p>

<p>Cell Phones, Windows 10 and all operating systems are backdoored.
- This will eventually run on a MIPs or ARM processor, that is not even running an operating system.</p>

<p>There is an RPC between the client and exchange server. There are a small number of actions on the command channel.
- Check BTC balance [address list]
- Check SKY balance [address list]
- Withdrawal Bitcoin (pull coins from local wallet)
- Deposit Bitcoin (push coins form local wallet)
- Withdraw Skycoin (pull coins from local wallet)
- Deposit Skycoin (push coin from local wallet)
- Place Bid/Ask (update order book)
- Cancel Bid/Ask</p>

<p>Then there are events such as
- order book updates
- coins received into address
- pending withdraw completed (transaction executed on blockchain)
- bid/ask order executed</p>

<p>The command and event channel are asynchronous and will run over anything that can send bytes. In this case I am running over uTP.
- Bitmessage
- IRC
- TOX
- Torchat, etc
- email
- SMS
- tor</p>

<p>Eventually it should be possible to have multiple transports and go hop to hop from nodes to communicate with a destination designated by a public key hash (purpose of the darknet/meshnet/vpn).</p>

<p>This is moving away from
- no dependence upon the operating system
- no dependence upon a web browser
- no dependence upon DNS
- no dependence upon HTTPS
- no C code that can be buffer overflowed (memory safe)
- no external library dependencies (4,000 lines of code)
- easy to extend or modify</p>

<p>Maybe will have a command line for getting the unspent outputs for an address or creating transactions by hand.</p>

<p>Right now, the exchange just has to replace bitmessage for buying/selling, because it is too slow and frustrating.</p>

<p>This is also a test, to see if this is the right interface type for darknet/vpn/routing administration.</p>
