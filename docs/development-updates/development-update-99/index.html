<h2 id="project-priorities">Project Priorities:</h2>

<h5 id="right-now-the-priorities-are">Right now the priorities are:</h5>

<ul>
<li>Improve project management</li>
<li>Have a place where everything that needs to be done, can be written down as a ticket so developers can find it</li>
<li>Get developers to implement the tickets</li>
</ul>

<p>We not have a radical simplification of the consensus implementation and simplification of the meshnet/vpn/darknet and it is almost trivial. It should not be more than 2,000 lines for the core, but we need to make sure it gets implemented.</p>

<p>Finding good contractors and people to work on project has been very time consuming.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development:</h2>

<h5 id="right-now">Right now</h5>

<ul>
<li>Wallet cross compilation was done months ago</li>
<li>We need to get gulp script working that dumps angular js 2.0 example app, into &ldquo;dist&rdquo; directory we can serve from golang. This is amazingly frustrating.</li>
<li>We need to port the skycoin webwallet to angular 2.0 eventually (not high priority)</li>
<li>We are having meeting and trying to get SKY/BTC exchange up as next priority</li>
<li>We figured out how to simplify consensus implementation</li>
</ul>

<p>The meshnet/vpn/darknet has undergone radical simplification. It very clear what is needed at this stage and is almost a joke. I do not have an excuse for not finishing this or hiring someone to do it. I have a triangle of three components, which depend on the other two components and together it just works.</p>
