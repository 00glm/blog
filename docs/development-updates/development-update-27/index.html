<h2 id="summary">Summary:</h2>

<p>Aether is coming along well. Soon development discussion will be moved into Aether. Coin bounties will be assigned for developing communication tools on Aether.</p>

<h6 id="for-instance">For instance:</h6>

<ul>
<li>user creates private/public key pair</li>
<li>user publishes stream of tweets (as JSON) into blockchain and signs each block with their private key</li>
<li>user subscribes to another person&rsquo;s feed
&ndash; user takes hash (address) of person they want to subscribe to
&ndash; user looks up peers replicating the chain via DHT
&ndash; user connects to the peers and downloads the chain (which is replicated P2P)</li>
<li>web server on local hosts, allows person to see feeds of people they are pulling in</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of this is two lines of code in Skywire, so the work is creating a service in Golang and then taking the JSON and creating an HTML interface from it. This is a sort of &ldquo;App&rdquo; on top of Aether/Skycoin. Aether also implements a key-value store, which is probably more useful than blockchain for these types of apps.</p>

<p>Twitter is easiest to implement. It is not more difficult to implement a twitter clone on top of Aether than it is to implement one with Redis. Twitter is easiest to implement, because in distributed twitter, each user controls their own feed data.</p>

<h6 id="we-also-want">We also want:</h6>

<ul>
<li>a distributed forum</li>
<li>a distributed reddit</li>
<li>messaging (email replacement. most difficult)</li>
<li>a distributed wiki</li>
</ul>

<p>These will be used for coordinating development and building up the user community.</p>

<p>For a forum, the forum data would be controlled by a single public key. A user submitting something to forum, would message the forum with a signed message, then it would trigger API and forum server would update the forum data.</p>

<p>For a wiki, each key/value stores a page. The wiki data is controlled by a single public key. Users submit messages to the wiki server, the wiki server updates the data for the page. The updates are replicated peer-to-peer between subscribers to the Aether store. One key has AngularJS for generating the HTML website from the data in Aether.</p>

<h6 id="for-application-distribution-we-have-three-options">For application distribution we have three options:</h6>

<ol>
<li>make people pull the service/app from github</li>
<li>have key value store and put Javascript in key 0 (using AngularJS), that gives information for how to render the page and APIs. This means an &ldquo;app&rdquo; is javascript that generates the HTML locally and can call a limited number of APIs</li>
<li>Have a sandboxed, minimal virtual machine which apps are compiled down into. This is the best long-term solution, but we will use AngularJS until we can get this developed and it meets our security/quality standards.</li>
</ol>
