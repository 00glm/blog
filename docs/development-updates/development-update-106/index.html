<p>Going through the launch check list</p>

<p>Mostly check commit log:
- <a href="https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin">https://github.com/skycoin/skycoin</a></p>

<ul>
<li>block storage is done. Key/value store. boltdb. memory mapped files</li>
<li>blockchain history API is done. GUI is in progress.</li>
<li>first version of website is done. Second version in progress, then will be on domain. will post screenshots soon</li>
<li>some consensus simulations using random mean field sampling are in the repo in the /src/ directory now. We have someone starting on the public broadcast channel implementation and then remaining integration tasks. This should not block exchange listing, but may drag on for a while.</li>
<li>fifty tickets on UI and GUI bug fixes. Everything critical fixed.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="todo">Todo:</h5>

<ul>
<li>CLI for exchanges</li>
<li>WebRPC API for exchanges and documentation</li>
<li>GUI for blockchain history API</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wallet">Wallet:</h2>

<p>We have +50 tickets on development tasks for wallet QA, bugs, improvements and user interface behavior.</p>

<p>We are transitioning towards an electrum style wallet.</p>

<h2 id="exchange-listing-checklist">Exchange Listing Checklist</h2>

<p>Of the five things that were required, three of them are now done.
- block storage is done
- blockchain history API is done
- website is done</p>

<p>The last thing that is required is now
- CLI + WebRPC client for exchanges + documentation (required for exchange listing)
- Blockchain explorer front-end (required for exchange list. This was supposed to be done two days ago, but have not checked yet).
- documentation, info-graphics and technical information on website (this will be iterative over months)
- consensus integration (this is not blocking anything)</p>

<p>Our first exchange integration for testing and QA will be with a darkpool liquidity provider/market maker who sits on both sides of the order book and arbitrages from the major exchanges across multiple coins. Then will work on the large exchanges.</p>

<p>I think we have the APIs in place for automatic conversion between Bitcoin and Skycoin, in the wallet, so we can do something like Ethereum&rsquo;s &ldquo;ShapeShift&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Then after launch, wallet and future improvements
- Add Shapeshift
- Add multicoin support (Skycoin, Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- Electrum style interface
- Wallet encryption</p>

<h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>

<p>I want to say more about project management and changes and how we are dealing with this, but would be too long.</p>

<p>We are spawning off different project groups, with a single focus (website, marketing, coin, wallet QA, meshnet, applications, build/DevOps, consensus, exchange integration, mobile wallet team, project manager for customer facing applications for tech that was spun off or licensed to corporate clients, etc&hellip;). For development we are doing one to three developers per area and each developer has single focus or task.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last 10% is 90% of the work&rdquo;, is especially true for launching. Getting everything that needs to be in place ready, is a time sink. I think its taking six people, two months to get the requirements for listing done after the coin was &ldquo;finished&rdquo; and &ldquo;working&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So now we are focusing on one or two top priorities at a time and then assigning resources to them, to make incremental progress. Instead of doing long term R&amp;D and research of indefinite duration. We are also delegating or spinning off as many project groups we can and getting dedicated project managers to manage particular sub-projects. (wallet QA and wallet improvements has dedicated project manager now).</p>
