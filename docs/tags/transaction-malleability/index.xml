      <description>We had a productive day yesterday. Some people were able to get builds working immediately. Other people had problems with golang and path issues we are working through.
We launched the blockchain after a few hours of work. Fixed half a dozen bugs.  Several changes to build script Updated gvm curl build flags Updated to go1.4 Fixed bug with genesis block timestamp not accepting configuration setting Documentation here: https://piratepad.</description>
