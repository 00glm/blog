      <description>These are the things we need to fix for :  Launch Exchange listing There is a bug, where if you are running a skycoin node that starts with computer boot and you unplug the power to the server, there is a chance that the node wont start up again (corrupted files on disc, very annoying). However, we rename files before writing to ensure there are backups of the previous version, so We need a database that stores each transaction hash and the block that the transaction was executed in (for exchanges, to enable API to track skycoin transaction status) We need a database (sqllite?</description>

      <description>Project Priorities: Right now the priorities are:  Improve project management Have a place where everything that needs to be done, can be written down as a ticket so developers can find it Get developers to implement the tickets  We not have a radical simplification of the consensus implementation and simplification of the meshnet/vpn/darknet and it is almost trivial. It should not be more than 2,000 lines for the core, but we need to make sure it gets implemented.</description>

      <description>Priorities: There are many thing we want to do, but have to focus and defer a lot of things for future. Right now, there are a few things in progress.
1) Porting crypto to golang. To cross compile (to compile skycoin for windows, android, linux and OSX from a single server) all the code has to be in golang. Skycoin crypto wraps a secp256k1 library. This is being rewritten to golang but is an incredibly difficult and time consuming task.</description>
