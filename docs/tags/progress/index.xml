      <description>I have switched the peer list to json instead of csv and am merging in the blacklist and peer lists.
The new peer list format looks like.
This is first step to adding new fields to the peer list state and renabling PEX (peer-exchange). Fake peers were being spammed when we were using DHT for peer-discovery. This meant it could take up to two minutes to find a valid peer and begin downloading the blockchain.</description>

      <description>Organizational Update: The original plan was to put it on Aether, however it will be months before that is working. The networking refactor was a major headache, was a massive amount of work and ended up going nowhere, but took four months. The upside is that we have a very clear architecture now.
The current plan, is that the ICO prospectus is being written. It is about 200 pages. It lays out each component in the Skycoin project, in the details required for implementation.</description>
