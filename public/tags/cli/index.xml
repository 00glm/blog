      <description>Summary: We are launching our own post blockchain social platform. Starting with an immutable object replication system, inspired by Urbit and IPFS. Which is designed for decentralized social networking and source independent networking.
We started this on friday and we almost have a decentralized text only version of 4chan working, five days later.
