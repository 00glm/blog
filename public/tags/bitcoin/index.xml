      <description>Comment: Quote from: solix on April 08, 2017, 11:14:49 PM &amp;gt;hang on guys&amp;hellip; so 10% of the coins will be sold in the ICO? 90% held back, where 70% will be used &amp;ldquo;in the future&amp;rdquo;. Can you guys elaborate on that a bit? I&amp;rsquo;m interested in this project, but not while only 10% of the supply is circulating. I also suspect this will prevent quite a few exchanges from getting involved.</description>

      <description>Comment: Quote from: WigitGetIt on December 18, 2016, 02:58:55 AM &amp;gt;Lost me Here: Skycoin has no mining
 Good Luck.
 Response: Mining is a security flaw. Satoshi&amp;rsquo;s original vision was for a decentralized cryptocurrency. The Bitcoin network is controlled by three mining pools. At one point Gigahash.io controlled over 65% of the network.
The objective of the Skycoin project from the start was to fix the problems in Bitcoin.</description>

      <description>Comment: Quote from: esuncloud on December 19, 2014, 05:24:09 PM &amp;gt;We are experts with Verilog, CPLD, FPGA, ASIC, SoC design, and how could we help you guys? According to my knowledge, there is no Verilog repo on Github for us to contribute code.
Response: This is an amplitude modulated software defined radio for the whitespace band. 100 Mhz to 700 Mhz carrier. This is the most simple type of radio possible.</description>

      <description>Comment: Quote from: illodin on May 07, 2015, 12:05:22 AM &amp;gt; Is there any use of running &amp;ldquo;full nodes&amp;rdquo; or w/e they are called in Skycoin, i.e. running the client with port 6000 open?
Response: Yes. PM me your node IP address and I will add it to the default list.
Skycoin has two modes of peer-to-peer connections - DHT lookup - PEX
DHT is disabled by default now and pex is disabled until there is time to fix issue.</description>

      <description>Ask The Developers Anything - Session #4 Comment: Quote from: JessicaMILFson on April 10, 2014, 02:20:17 AM &amp;gt;When you launch, are you going to have video tutorials, or things explaining this? Because I have no idea what the above means. It seems more complicated than Bitcoin, and adoption is a big concern if there is no way to simplify this.
Response: This is for developers. For end users, you will double click the icon and the wallet will pop up.</description>

      <description>Ask The Developers Anything - Session #5 Comment: Quote from: FrictionlessCoin on April 26, 2014, 01:29:41 PM &amp;gt;I for one would be wary about owning a coin on a network that is still undergoing changes.
 The alternative of course is to just wait until you are ready.
Or take the NEX approach of receiving pledges but not transferring coin until we&amp;rsquo;re ready.
 Response: The blockchain security is solid.</description>

      <description>Ask The Developers Anything - Session #3 Comment: Quote from: td services on March 23, 2014, 04:01:09 PM &amp;gt;Does the above display look right, or should I be seeing some numbers or transaction activity?
 I&amp;rsquo;m trying it out an ArchLinux install now to run it on Beaglebone once I get it running on Virtualbox on the Indiebox stack.
 Response: Yes. You have it working! The wallet gui is running a GTK window that embeds webkit.</description>

      <title>Choosing an IPO Date</title>

      <guid>http://blog.skycoin.net/blog-posts/choosing-an-ipo-date/</guid>
      <description>Choosing an IPO Date: There are two options.
 We set a date and the IPO occurs on that date, whether coin is ready or not. We wait until coin is ready (keeps getting pushed back) and announce IPO after its ready.  The coin launch and IPO will definitely occur before Obelisk is implemented, which may take through July.
Does Febuary 24th, noon GMT time for IPO sound good?</description>

      <title>Thoughts on Marketing and Speculation</title>

      <guid>http://blog.skycoin.net/blog-posts/thoughts-on-marketing-and-speculation/</guid>
      <description>Thoughts on Marketing and Speculation: Skycoin marketing is highly targeted at influence groups and communities who need to know about Skycoin. The objective of Skycoin marketing is to build out the community and build awareness. Skycoin is not doing broad marketing aimed at public to &amp;ldquo;pump&amp;rdquo; prices to unsustainable levels. Skycoin will not be paying Lady Gaga to make a Skycoin music video.
Marketing tactics designed to cause bubbles and bursts are great for speculators, day trading and people organizing the pumps, but conflict with Skycoin&amp;rsquo;s objective of low volatility and stable price levels.</description>

      <guid>http://blog.skycoin.net/blog-posts/twostep--post-quantum-secure-transactions/</guid>
      <description>TwoStep: Post Quantum Secure Transactions Future advances in mathematics may render Bitcoin insecure. This is a draft protocol for securing cryptocoin transactions against future advances in mathematics or computing which render discrete logarithm based public key cryptography insecure.
TwoStep is part of QuantumEclipse, a suite of next-gen cryptocoin protocols developed under OP Darknet Plan for the Skycoin Project.
This protocol is - simple - adaptable to Bitcoin - lower overhead than Lamport Signatures - works with SHA256 preimages equally as well as Secp256k1 signatures - not dependent on the security of discrete logarithm based public key cryptography</description>

      <description>Ask The Developers Anything - Session #2 Comment: Quote from: Sage on January 01, 2014, 07:49:40 AM &amp;gt;Why is nobody contesting the obvious&amp;hellip;?
 Endless 2% inflation? And who gets that wealth? Developers? For the &amp;ldquo;public good&amp;rdquo; of course.
&amp;rdquo;- All coins are created in genesis block.&amp;rdquo; (Effectively a 100% premine.)
&amp;rdquo;- The coins will be distributed in a fair, open process.&amp;rdquo; (Fair and open according to who?)
Did we easily forget Google&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t be evil&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Overview of Obelisk: Distributed Consensus </title>

      <guid>http://blog.skycoin.net/blog-posts/overview-of-obelisk/</guid>
      <description>Overview of Obelisk: Distributed Consensus In Obelisk, each person runs their own Obelisk nodes. Each node has a set of trust relationships with other nodes. Each node has a list of servers it &amp;ldquo;trusts&amp;rdquo;. A new node can be initialized by randomly choosing a few dozen existing nodes to trust, with only two or three of the nodes being nodes run by trusted institutions or persons.
Servers publish &amp;ldquo;blocks&amp;rdquo; every 5 seconds.</description>

      <description>Ask The Developers Anything - Session #1 Comment: Quote from: Eliavres on December 22, 2013, 03:07:20 AM &amp;gt;Hmm this might just be a game changer..
 Since youre just starting to introduce this coin - for the love of god look at what viral advertising has turned Dogecoin into. Here&amp;rsquo;s something I posted in another thread:
 Quote from: Eliavres on December 22, 2013, 03:02:58 AM &amp;gt;I like dogecoin because it is the proof that marketing, be it by a snazzy name or proper advertising or such, plays a major role in the success of a coin.</description>
