      <description>Summary: Everything is going very rapidly. We will be out of new things to code within a finite amount of time on the current trajectory. All the project goals will have been achieved and then we need to figure out what happens next.
1) We must finish the developer documentation and tutorials. 2) We must do the distribution.
When we started development, Golang was experimental and frustrating. Build reproducability was difficult, developers were stepping on each others toes and debugging goroutines was impossible.</description>
