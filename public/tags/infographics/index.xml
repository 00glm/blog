      <description>Skycoin Market Making Bot: We have a market making bot, that will sit on the bid/ask for skycoin for the following exchanges - Poloniex - C2CX - Bittrex - Cryptopia
The bot is in java and has three different trading strategies you can set. It was developed by a third party and will be released publicly.
You can set rules, like a spread and if the price between two exchanges goes more than 5% difference the bot will automatically arbitrage the spread and make you money.</description>
