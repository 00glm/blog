      <description>Comment: Quote from: Tobo on May 04, 2014, 02:11:12 PM &amp;gt;I noticed that you previously used the name of ether which was used by Ethereum. Now you changed it to aether which has been used by some other people at this forum. Why did you like these two names so much?
Ether permutes space. Then we found out ether is alcohol that people snuff to get high and aether is the mystical substance that permutes space.</description>
